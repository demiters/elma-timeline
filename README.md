##Help us document Elma history

Everyone is currently welcome to contribute information about everything noteworthy that's ever happened in the community. Entries are best supported with references - links, pictures, videos, replay/level and other files, even IRC logs are valuable.

The Google spreadsheet that we use to collect this information is easy and convenient for people to edit and collaborate in but before you enter it you need to read and stick to the rules. Read [this section of the TimelineJS README](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS#google-docs).

Do not leave any row in the sheet empty. Additional help can be found [here](http://timeline.knightlab.com/#help).
